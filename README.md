# Cryptocurrency Dashboard

## Overview
This repository contains a simulated cryptocurrency transaction dataset and visualizations created to demonstrate data analysis and dashboard-building skills. The dataset includes 30 days of transaction data, including transaction volumes, counts, and average transaction values.

## Dataset
The dataset is stored in the file `crypto_transaction_data.csv`. It contains the following columns:

- **Date**: The date of the transaction.
- **Transaction Volume (BTC)**: Total transaction volume for the day in Bitcoin (BTC).
- **Transaction Count**: Total number of transactions for the day.
- **Average Transaction Value (BTC)**: Average value per transaction in Bitcoin (BTC).

## Visualizations
Three visualizations have been created to analyze and showcase trends in the dataset:

1. **Transaction Volume Over Time**:
   - Shows the daily total transaction volume in BTC.
   - File: `transaction_volume_over_time.png`

2. **Transaction Count Over Time**:
   - Displays the daily number of transactions.
   - File: `transaction_count_over_time.png`

3. **Average Transaction Value Over Time**:
   - Illustrates the average value per transaction in BTC over time.
   - File: `avg_transaction_value_over_time.png`

## How to Use
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the dataset (`crypto_transaction_data.csv`) to view the raw data.
3. View the visualizations to analyze trends in the data.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python** for data processing and visualization.
- **Matplotlib** for creating visualizations.
- **CSV** format for storing the dataset.
